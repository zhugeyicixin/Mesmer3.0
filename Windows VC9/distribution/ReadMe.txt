           MESMER (Master Equation Solver for Multi Energy-well Reactions) 

models the interaction between collisional energy transfer and chemical reaction for dissociation,
isomerization and association processes.

It is capable of solving the energy grained master equation (EGME) for a unimolecular system
composed of an arbitrary number of wells, transition states, sinks, and reactants.

Mesmer is a command line program and should be run by first opening a DOS window, normally with the current directory as the folder containing the input file. Then type:

  mesmer infile.xml
  
  
A Start Menu Programs item contains links to:

 - The Mesmer folder. Subfolders contain examples and it is recommended that you base your own initial datafiles in parallel subfolders.

 - MESMER manual.doc

 - a tutorial, Constructing a Datafile from Gaussian output.html

 

To edit and recompile the C++ source code for Mesmer, download the project from SourceForge via SVN.
